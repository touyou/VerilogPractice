There is a large setup violation of -48.000 ns between design_1_i/div32p2_0/inst/x_reg_reg[34]/C (clocked by clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0) and design_1_i/div32p2_0/inst/r_reg[16]/D (clocked by clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
